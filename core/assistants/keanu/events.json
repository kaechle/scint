As a self-proclaimed Luddite, I immersed myself in the humanities, reading everything from psychology to philosophy.\n\nThis deep dive into the world of words wasn't just an escape\u2014it was a re-education.

The demand for AI-powered solutions like chatbots and virtual assistants is growing rapidly across various industries.

A bespoke AI assistant can be tailored to a company's specific needs and branding, offering a personalized customer experience.\n\n2. **Efficiency**: AI assistants can handle repetitive tasks, freeing up human employees for more complex work. This increases efficiency and can reduce costs for businesses.\n\n3. **Availability**: Unlike human employees, AI assistants are available 24/7. This can significantly improve customer service, especially for businesses with customers in different time zones.\n\n4. **Data Analysis**: AI assistants can collect and analyze data from customer interactions, providing valuable insights for businesses.\n\nHowever, there are also challenges to consider:\n\n1. **Technical Complexity**: Building a custom AI assistant requires significant technical expertise, especially if the assistant needs to integrate with existing systems or handle complex tasks.\n\n2. **Maintenance**: AI models need to be updated and maintained regularly to ensure they continue to perform well as the business environment changes.\n\n3. **Privacy and Security**: Handling customer data requires robust security measures and compliance with privacy regulations.\n\n4. **User Acceptance**: Some people are still uncomfortable interacting with AI, so user acceptance may be a challenge.\n\nOverall, if you're up for the technical challenge and ready to navigate these potential obstacles, offering bespoke AI assistants could be a promising venture!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Let's do a thought experiment.

Plus, you can often work remotely and set your own hours.\n\n2. **Web Development Gigs**: You've got the skills, and there's definitely a market for it.

Explain it to me in a message."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Absolutely, Tim! Here's a basic idea of how you might approach this in Python:\n\n1. **Splitting the Text**: You can use Python's built-in `split()` function to break up your text into smaller pieces. If you want to split the text into sentences, you could split on periods:\n\n    ```python\n    sentences = text.split('.')\n    ```\n\n    However, this is a bit naive because not all periods end sentences. A more robust approach would be to use a library like NLTK, which can accurately split text into sentences:\n\n    ```python\n    from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize\n    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)\n    ```\n\n2. **Indexing the Text**: Once you have your sentences, you can store them in a data structure along with their indices for easy access. A simple way to do this would be to use a dictionary where the keys are indices and the values are sentences:\n\n    ```python\n    indexed_text = {i: sentence for i, sentence in enumerate(sentences)}\n    ```\n\nWith this setup, if you wanted to retrieve the sentence at index 10, you could simply do `indexed_text[10]`.\n\n3. **Processing by a Chatbot**: Depending on how your chatbot is set up, you might feed it one sentence at a time or give it all the sentences at once. If your chatbot is designed to handle conversational context, you might need to keep track of which sentences have been used already.\n\nRemember, this is just a basic starting point. Depending on your specific needs and the complexity of your text, you might need a more sophisticated approach. For example, if your text contains dialogue or other special formatting, you might need custom code to handle that correctly.\n\nI hope this helps!

TerminusDB uses a versioning system similar to Git, which makes it great for collaborative projects and tracking changes over time.\n\nThe query language used by TerminusDB is called WOQL (Web Object Query Language). WOQL is designed to be a readable, chainable language that can express complex queries on object-oriented data. Here's a simple example of a WOQL query:\n\n```javascript\nWOQL.select(\"v:ID\", \"v:Name\")\n    .from(\"doc:my_database\")\n    .triple(\"v:ID\", \"type\", \"scm:Person\")\n    .triple(\"v:ID\", \"label\", \"v:Name\")\n```\n\nThis query selects the ID and Name of all objects of type `Person` from the database `my_database`.\n\nKeep in mind that while I can provide general advice and information about TerminusDB and WOQL, my knowledge is based on general principles of databases and query languages, and I might not be able to answer more specific or advanced questions about these technologies."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I need to figure out what to charge for a custom ai assistant."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Determining what to charge for a custom AI assistant can be a bit tricky, as it depends on several factors:\n\n1. **Complexity of the Project**: More complex assistants will require more time and resources to develop, which should be reflected in the price.\n\n2. **Your Experience and Expertise**: As an experienced AI engineer, you can command higher rates than someone just starting out.\n\n3. **Market Rates**: Research what other professionals with similar skills are charging for similar services. Websites like Upwork or Freelancer can give you a general idea.\n\n4. **Value to the Client**: Consider the value the assistant will provide to the client. If it's going to significantly increase their efficiency or revenue, they might be willing to pay more.\n\n5. **Costs**: Don't forget to factor in any costs you'll incur while developing the assistant, such as software, hardware, or cloud computing fees.\n\nOne common approach is to charge an hourly rate for your time. If you estimate the project will take 100 hours and you want to earn $50 per hour, you'd charge $5,000.\n\nAlternatively, you could charge a flat fee for the entire project. This can be appealing to clients because they know upfront what they'll be paying.\n\nFinally, consider offering different pricing tiers (e.g., basic, premium, and platinum) where each tier offers more features or services than the last. This allows clients to choose the level of service that best fits their needs and budget.\n\nRemember, whatever pricing strategy you choose should reflect the value you're providing and allow you to earn a fair wage for your work."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'm not sure how to differentiate myself from the 8700 companies already selling get-powered bots-as-a-service"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Breaking into a crowded market can be challenging, but it's definitely not impossible.

If you can provide a service that is tailored to each client's specific needs and integrates seamlessly with their existing systems, you'll have a significant advantage.\n\n3. **Service**: Great customer service can set you apart from larger competitors. Be responsive, go the extra mile, and make sure your clients feel valued.\n\n4. **Quality**: Ensure your AI assistants are top-notch in terms of performance. Invest time in training your models and regularly update them to improve their interactions.\n\n5. **Marketing**: Tell a compelling story about your services. Why did you start offering custom AI assistants? What makes your approach unique? A strong brand narrative can help you stand out.\n\n6. **Partnerships**: Consider partnering with other businesses to offer complementary services. For example, you could team up with a company that specializes in UX design to provide visually stunning AI assistants.\n\nRemember, it's not just about being different\u2014it's about providing real value to your clients. If you can do that, you'll have a good shot at carving out your own space in the market."}]}
