# Scint

- A collection is a collection of related data explicitly-defined data, such as a book or a project directory the user
  adds
- Vaults represent a collection of related data, such as multiple work projects, relevant documentation, and
  conversations regarding said projects and documentation
- Gates are edges that connect vaults to other vaults, forming complex relationships between data as well as providing
  signal pathways for context shifts
- Routines are narrowly-defined tasks with limited context windows, like writing a function or composing a paragraph
- The composer updates prompts, functions, and other attributes based on context as it changes from incoming user
  requests, ongoing interactions, and system events
- A context represents a single location and the processes running within its event loop; it manages the overall task or
  goal

> “Finally there he returns, trying to imitate in his walk the inflexible stiffness of some kind of automaton while carrying his tray with the recklessness of a tight-rope-walker by putting it in a perpetually unstable, perpetually broken equilibrium which he perpetually reestablishes by a light movement of the arm and hand. All his behavior seems to us a game. He applies himself to chaining his movements as if they were mechanisms, the one regulating the other; his gestures and even his voice seem to be mechanisms; he gives himself the quickness and pitiless rapidity of things. He is playing, he is amusing himself. But what is he playing? We need not watch long before we can explain it: he is playing at being a waiter in a café."

## Questions

1. User Interface and Experience

- What specific widgets and metrics are needed on the control panel for each server type?
- How should the interface layout be structured to maximize usability and efficiency?
- Are there customization options for the dashboard or widgets that users can modify?

2. Server and Dashboard Functionality

- What types of servers (e.g., web, application, database) and specific functionalities should be accessible through the
  control panel?
- How are the metrics for each widget sourced and updated in real-time?
- What are the technical requirements for the graphs and analytics (e.g., real-time updates, historical data
  visualization)?

3. AI Capabilities and Natural Language Processing

- What level of natural language understanding is required? Does it need to support multiple languages or dialects?
- How should the system handle ambiguous or incomplete user inputs?
- What backend architecture supports the AI’s decision-making processes?

4. Integration and Intercommunication

- How will different systems communicate and share context or state information?
- What protocols or technologies will be used to ensure seamless, secure communication between systems?
- Are there fallbacks or manual overrides if AI decisions need to be reviewed or corrected by human operators?

5. Security and Data Privacy

- What security measures are required to protect user data and unauthorized access to the control panel?
- How will data be encrypted, both at rest and in transit?
- Are there compliance or regulatory considerations depending on the server locations or data types?

6. Scalability and Maintenance

- How scalable should the backend be to handle potential increases in users or data volume?
- What tools and processes will be implemented for monitoring, logging, and maintaining the system?
- How will updates and upgrades be managed without disrupting ongoing operations?

7. Emergency Protocols and Thresholds

- How does the system recognize and handle potential emergencies or failures?
- What are the specific thresholds for alerts and automatic adjustments?
- How are these thresholds set, and can they be adjusted by users?

## Processing

## Context as Identity

 1. create an embedding of every incoming message
 2. determine how to route message based on content and available context
 3. record this determination
 4. use past determinations as available context for incoming messages


- Context-based Action Framework:
   - Create specific contexts (Provider, Composer, Container, Handler, Processor, Thread) for different types of actions or resources.
   - Define a set of high-level operations for each context that LLMs can invoke.
   - Implement these operations as methods within each context class.

- Message-driven Architecture:
   - Utilize the existing message processing structure (subscribe, process_message, publish_message) to create a communication layer between LLMs and the system.
   - Define a standardized message format that includes the context, action, and parameters.

- Hierarchical LLM Structure:
   - Create a hierarchy of LLM processes, each responsible for different levels of abstraction or different domains.
   - Higher-level LLMs can decompose complex tasks into simpler subtasks for lower-level LLMs.

- Dynamic Context Creation:
   - Allow LLMs to create new contexts or modify existing ones using the create_context function.
   - This enables the system to adapt and expand its capabilities based on LLM inputs.

- Resource Abstraction:
   - Use the Container context to represent abstract resources that LLMs can manipulate.
   - Implement methods within the Container class to perform high-level operations on these resources.

- Task Orchestration:
   - Utilize the Composer context to create complex workflows or sequences of actions across different contexts.
   - Allow LLMs to define and execute these workflows.

- Asynchronous Processing:
   - Leverage the existing asynchronous structure to handle multiple LLM requests concurrently.
   - Use the Thread context to manage and coordinate parallel processing of tasks.

- State Management:
   - Implement a state management system using the ContextMap and ContextMapView classes.
   - Allow LLMs to query and modify the state of different contexts.

- Error Handling and Logging:
   - Utilize the existing logging mechanism (__logger__ decorator) to provide feedback to LLMs about the execution of their requests.
   - Implement error handling mechanisms that can provide meaningful feedback to LLMs.

- Natural Language Interface:
    - Create a natural language processing layer that can interpret LLM requests and map them to specific context actions.
    - This could involve using the LLM itself to parse and understand more complex instructions.

These strategies can be combined and adapted to create a flexible, extensible system that allows LLMs to interact with and manipulate abstract resources and data at a high level. The key is to provide a clear, consistent interface that LLMs can understand and use effectively.
