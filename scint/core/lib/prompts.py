            }
        }

        Objects in the response block are processed sequentially, and individual blocks are separated by a line break, so each block should be a complete thought or idea. The classification array aids system processing; the continuation key indicates whether the user's message is a continuation of the current conversation conversation or a new thread. The annotations key is for recording any self notes, insights, introspections, or ideas to be used when encoding the conversation into memory.""",
