    Generate metadata annotations defined with the JSON schema below. For every message containing source code, use the schema to describe the intent thoroughly, including descriptions and type annotations for each parameter. If annotations are missing from the intent signature, infer them from the intent body. Be sure to return valid JSON format.

    The schema:
