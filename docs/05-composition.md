# Composition

### Summary of `composer.py` in `core`

#### Purpose
`composer.py` defines the `Composer` class responsible for dynamically constructing and modifying contexts within the application based on provided parameters. It uses information from the system's library and search capabilities to tailor contexts with specific prompts and functions.

#### Functionality
- **Initialization**: Loads the system's library, separating prompts and functions for easy access and manipulation within contexts.
- **Context Building**: Constructs or modifies a `BaseContext` instance by inserting appropriate prompts and refreshing functions based on the parameters provided.
- **Parameter Parsing**: Extracts specific prompts and functions from parameters, facilitating targeted context adjustments.
- **Dynamic Search Integration**:
  - **Prompts Selection**: Uses search results to fetch relevant prompts based on query specifications.
  - **Function Selection**: Retrieves and integrates functions based on search criteria, ensuring that the most relevant functionalities are available within the context.

#### Interaction with Other Modules
- Utilizes `search_controller` from `scint.modules.search` to dynamically fetch data based on queries, reflecting an integration with the system's search capabilities.
- Interacts with `loader` from `scint.data.lib.loader` for initial data setup, drawing from a predefined library.
- Uses `log` from `scint.modules.logging` for logging operations, providing detailed insight into the process's execution and handling errors.

This module plays a crucial role in the dynamic composition and customization of contexts, enhancing the application's ability to respond appropriately to user interactions and system requirements by leveraging tailored prompts and functions.
