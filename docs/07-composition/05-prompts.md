# Function Specification

- Name: The name of the function.
- Description: A brief description of what the function does and its significance in the wider system.
- Context: Describe where in the system this function operates and its dependencies.

## Requirements

- Definition: The type of function, such as standard, coroutine, async generator, and so on.
- Parameters: List all input parameters, including types and acceptable values/ranges.
- Return value: The expected return value of the function in normal conditions.
- Constraints: Any constraints that the function must adhere to during execution.
- Preconditions: Conditions that must be true before the function is called.
- Postconditions: What conditions must be true after the function execution (related to the output).


## Design

- Pseudocode: Provide a high-level pseudocode that outlines the algorithm used in the function.
- Complexity: Theoretical analysis of time and space complexity, if applicable.
- Exceptions: Types of exceptions the function might throw and under what circumstances.
- Fallbacks: Describe any fallback mechanisms if the function execution fails.

## Metadata

- Metadata: The metadata object used to index the function and provide instructions to language models.

## Testing

- Standard
- Edge case
- Error case: Conditions under which the function is expected to fail.

- Description: A description of the test case.
- Input: The input or parameters to use for testing.
- Expected result: The expected function output for the provided input.



4.3 Error Case

	•	Description: Conditions under which the function is expected to fail.
	•	Input: Inputs that will cause the function to throw exceptions or fail.
	•	Expected Output/Behavior: How the function should signal failure (e.g., exception thrown).

##	Dependencies

		•	External Libraries: List any external libraries or other functions this function depends on.
		•	System Dependencies: Any system or hardware-specific dependencies.
