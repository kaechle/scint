### Summary of `SearchController` in `search_controller.py`

#### Purpose
`SearchController` manages interactions with MeiliSearch, an open-source search engine, to handle operations related to indexing and querying data. It provides functionalities for creating, updating, and deleting indexes and documents, and adjusting search settings to optimize query results.

#### Functionality
- **Initialization**: Configures the MeiliSearch client with the necessary URL and API key.
- **Search Operations**:
  - Executes search queries with optional category filters and hybrid semantic settings.
  - Handles index and document management operations including creating, deleting, and updating indexes and documents.
- **Index Management**:
  - Regularly updates indexes by loading data from a specified source, ensuring that search data remains current and accurate.
- **Asynchronous HTTP Requests**:
  - Uses `aiohttp` for asynchronous HTTP requests to update settings and enable experimental features in MeiliSearch, accommodating advanced configuration needs.

#### Interaction with Other Modules
- Utilizes `env` from `scint.support.utils` for environment variable management.
- Interacts with `loader` from `scint.core.lib.loader` to fetch data for indexing.
- Heavy reliance on the logging module to provide detailed logs for all operations, aiding in troubleshooting and monitoring of the search service's performance.

This module is crucial for maintaining an effective and efficient search capability within the application, ensuring that data is easily retrievable and that the search engine's configuration is continually optimized.
