# Context

Mapping non-code text in a way similar to ctags for code repositories is an interesting challenge. The goal would be to create an index or "map" of the text that allows you to quickly navigate to specific sections based on keywords or topics. Here are a few approaches you might consider:

- Information Retrieval Techniques: You could use techniques from the field of information retrieval to index the text. This could involve creating an inverted index that maps each word to the locations where it appears in the text. More advanced techniques could involve using a vector space model or latent semantic indexing to capture the semantic meaning of the text.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP techniques could be used to extract more structured information from the text. For example, named entity recognition could be used to identify the names of people, places, or things. Topic modeling could be used to identify the main topics discussed in the text. This information could then be used to create a more structured index or "map" of the text.
- Text Segmentation: This involves breaking the text down into smaller segments, such as sentences or paragraphs, and then indexing these segments. This could be combined with other techniques, such as NLP or information retrieval, to create a more detailed map of the text.
- Document Classification: If you have a large collection of documents, you could use machine learning techniques to classify the documents into different categories based on their content. This could help users navigate the collection and find the documents that are most relevant to their interests.
- Hyperlinking: This involves creating hyperlinks within the text that allow users to navigate between related sections. This could be done manually, or it could be automated using NLP or information retrieval techniques.
- Summarization: This involves creating a summary of each section of the text, which could be used to give users a quick overview of the content. This could be done manually, or it could be automated using NLP techniques.
- Ontologies: This involves creating a structured representation of the knowledge contained in the text. This could involve identifying the main concepts discussed in the text and the relationships between them. This could be done manually, or it could be automated using NLP techniques.
