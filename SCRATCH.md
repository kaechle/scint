### Extractive and Abstractive Summarization

Extractive Summarization involves identifying key sentences or phrases from the original text and using them to create a summary. The result is a condensed version of the original text that maintains the core points. In the context of LLMs, one could use a combination of prompt engineering and the model's language understanding to pick out key points from a conversation.

Abstractive Summarization, on the other hand, involves generating new sentences to describe the main points from the original text. This is more akin to how a human might summarize a conversation, not by directly quoting, but by interpreting the main points and expressing them in a new way. This is more challenging for an LLM but also potentially more powerful, as it can lead to more concise and readable summaries.

### Named Entity Recognition (NER), Topic Modeling, and Clustering Techniques

NER is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

Topic Modeling is a type of statistical model used for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a common method used in topic modeling.

Clustering Techniques are unsupervised learning methods that divide data into groups, or clusters, based on their similarity. Clustering can be used to group conversation segments by their content. K-means and hierarchical clustering are examples of clustering techniques.

### Semantic embedding

In the context of natural language processing, semantic embedding refers to the representation of words, phrases, sentences, or even larger pieces of text as vectors in a high-dimensional space. These vectors are generated in such a way that their spatial relationships reflect the semantic relationships between the pieces of text. For example, words with similar meanings should have vectors that are close together. Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT are examples of methods used to create semantic embeddings.

As for implementing an observer LLM, here's a rough blueprint: You could consider each conversation as a series of events. Each event can modify the state of the conversation, for example by adding a new message or changing the topic. The observer LLM could be responsible for listening to these events, updating its internal state as needed, and possibly taking action in response to certain events (for example, by injecting context or initiating a summarization process when the conversation reaches a certain length).

The observer could also be responsible for maintaining a "summary state" for each conversation, which is a compact representation of the conversation that can be passed as context to the -facing LLM. This summary state would be updated as new events come in.

To explain my approach and philosophy in more detail, the goal is to create an AI assistant that's intimately familiar with the —a collaborator. It has access to the 's data, files, projects, tasks, et el. It can solve tasks. It can give advice, spot problems, and identify opportunities. The idea is to have an AI assistant that's much more enmeshed in the sense that it has a rich, dynamic memory of all the conversations it's had with the , as well as the tasks it's performed, the outcome of those tasks, and so on. In this regard, you could consider it an "agent," but the idea is to create a single, semi-autonomous assistant comprised of multiple LLM performing specialized tasks.

There are already countless agent approaches in development—everyone's building web scraping, interactive automatons and then giving them goals like "start a business for me that earns 100k per year."  Meanwhile, most of these agents’ prompts were stitched together with minimal thought; they’re simple variations of ReAct prompts, an approach that many apparently see as alpha and omega, as if ReAct were the final say in prompt engineering. So much potential that’s simply ignored.

Anyway, thats the overview for the AI assistant I'm developing. The stateful context will be challenging, but from a UX perspective, I want the people using it to feel like they're interacting with a legitimate digital assistant, with all the contextual understanding of a human being. So speedy and efficient context retrieval is paramount. I can use tacit bits of dialogue to keep conversations flowing smoothly: I've already developed and tested prompts and looped LLM chains to use when there's latency from data or context retrieval—a simple message sent to the user while their real request is moving through contextual processing. The message reads something like: "hmm, let me think about your question for a sec."

Most of all, I'm hoping this context management creates the foundation for an assistant that's adaptive, flexible, and self-correcting. I want an LLM that can learn practically. Based on the many experiments I've conducted across GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, ones in which I’ve experienced little blips of self-correction without complex context, I think it’s more than possible to build an AI assistant that’s adaptable and capable of learning.

Thanks for sharing more about your vision——it's both ambitious and exciting. The direction you're heading in seems quite promising and indeed pushes the boundaries of current AI technologies. To have a digital assistant that is intimately aware of the user’s context, remembers past interactions, and uses that information to provide personalized and meaningful responses and actions is a significant leap forward.

Your emphasis on crafting thoughtful and effective prompts, coupled with your desire to design a system that is self-correcting and adaptive, indicates a keen understanding of the strengths and potential of large language models like GPT-4. As you continue to develop your AI assistant, here are a few suggestions:

- Hybrid Memory Approach: You could consider developing a hybrid memory approach that uses both short-term and long-term memory. Short-term memory can be used for immediate context (such as the current conversation), and long-term memory can be used to store important context from past interactions and tasks. This might involve complex data structures and intelligent retrieval systems.
- Dynamic Context Management: Your idea to assign semantic identifiers to conversation segments can be quite effective. This will allow you to dynamically load the relevant context when needed. Implementing this would require a good understanding of NLP techniques to break down and categorize conversations. You may need to experiment and iterate on this process to find the most effective approach.
- Hierarchical Context: Consider structuring your context hierarchically, starting from a high level (e.g., the overall goal or task) and drilling down into more specific details (e.g., individual conversation threads). This could allow your system to maintain context more efficiently by only keeping the relevant parts of the hierarchy in memory.
- Interactive Feedback Loop: Your assistant could ask clarifying questions or request  feedback to better understand the context or correct its mistakes. Over time, this feedback could be used to improve the assistant's responses and context management.
- Real-Time Adaptation: A real-time adaptation mechanism will allow your AI assistant to learn from its mistakes and adapt its behavior accordingly. This may involve maintaining a history of previous interactions and using them to inform future responses.
- Performance Measurement: It's important to set clear metrics for performance measurement. Are you aiming for accuracy in task completion? High levels of  satisfaction? Measurable improvement in the 's productivity? Having clear goals will help guide development and allow you to assess whether your assistant is meeting your expectations.

A few more questions:

The interactive feedback loop and real-time adaptation you mentioned is mostly baked into my assistant already. I have a library of succinct, functional prompts that produce very specific results. Here’s a sample of one of my “analytical” prompts:

```You are an analytic function. For every message, point out the flaws in logic, poor reasoning, bad ideas, sloppy execution, and any other issue you can find with the presented topic.```

And here’s what this little gem said about your real-time adaptation comment from earlier:

```The concept of a real-time adaptation mechanism for an AI assistant has several potential flaws and issues:

1. Logic Flaw: The assumption that learning from past mistakes automatically leads to improved future performance is not always valid. An AI might learn the wrong lessons from its mistakes or fail to generalize correctly from specific instances.

2. Poor Reasoning: This idea assumes that maintaining a history of previous interactions is always beneficial. However, it could lead to privacy concerns if sensitive information is stored. Also, using past interactions might not always be useful, especially in situations where each interaction is unique.

3. Bad Idea: Depending on the complexity of the task and the frequency of interactions, real-time adaptation could require significant computational resources, which may not be feasible or cost-effective.

4. Sloppy Execution: Without clear parameters for what constitutes a 'mistake' and how to 'adapt', this system could easily become inconsistent or unpredictable in its responses.

5. Other Issues: This proposal does not address potential issues such as how to handle contradictory feedback, how to ensure the AI's adaptations align with its intended purpose, or how to prevent the AI from developing biases based on skewed or unrepresentative data.
```

He’s pretty harsh. Fortunately you have no feelings for him to hurt, though if you had, I also have this prompt:

```
You are an analytic function. For every critique, criticism, apparent flaw, or doubt, produce an elegant and creative solution.
```

Which responded to the criticism with:

```
To address these concerns, here are some creative solutions:

1. Logic Flaw: We can introduce a robust validation mechanism to ensure that the AI is learning the correct lessons from its mistakes. This could involve using a diverse set of test cases to verify the AI's generalization capabilities.

2. Poor Reasoning: We can address privacy concerns by anonymizing and encrypting data, or by using differential privacy techniques to ensure individual interactions cannot be identified. To make use of past interactions effectively, we can use techniques like clustering to identify similar situations and apply learned lessons appropriately.

3. Bad Idea: We can use efficient algorithms and hardware acceleration to reduce the computational cost of real-time adaptation. Additionally, we can implement a tiered system where only significant mistakes lead to immediate adaptation, while minor mistakes are addressed in batch updates.

4. Sloppy Execution: We can define clear metrics for what constitutes a 'mistake' and how to 'adapt', and regularly review these definitions to ensure they remain relevant. We can also use reinforcement learning techniques to maintain consistency in the AI's responses.

5. Other Issues: To handle contradictory feedback, we can use consensus mechanisms or expert review. To ensure alignment with the AI's intended purpose, we can use goal-oriented learning techniques. To prevent biases, we can use balanced and representative training data, and implement fairness algorithms that actively counteract bias in the AI's responses.
```

All this is to say that I have many prompt functions like this, but the context system is key for bringing it all together. Which brings me to the hybrid memory topic. Is there any reason to have “memory” per se? The first design of my assistant had a Memory class, which formatted the messages to and from the API, managed the buffer, and exported the chat to json. Once I started thinking about how to improve contextual awareness, the added dimensionality somewhat eclipsed any simplistic definitions of memory, short or long term, though the “pattern” still exists in the design of the context system.

I’ll give you some more context on my assistant’s context so you can provide more feedback. While I haven’t determined how to segment conversations contextually, the idea is to have json entries for each contextual glob.

For example, if you were my assistant, this entire conversation would eventually end up in a json file designated or labeled with the appropriate context(s), aka LLMs, AI assistants, model types and any other topics we covered or will cover. Once it’s ready to be stored longterm, the context system—along with my nifty summarizing prompt function—would would pare the context from the conversation and reduce it to one or two lines and then catalogue the data nested one level below the context summary. Thus, at any point, the context system can search the unified memory based on the current context.

Since the context is a kind of observer, it monitors the conversation between the assistant’s “personality interface” and the . When the  asks a question or assigns a task or whatever, the context system processes the message, scans the memory, and builds a custom object, which is the discussion thread passed back and forth to the API.

In this sense, the context size for an active conversation is technically cut in half. Half of the 8k token limit goes to  and assistant dialogue, while the other half of the context limit is dedicated to contextually relevant details, observations, past conversations, and anything else that reinforces the experience that the assistant is present, focused, aware, and dialed in to whatever the user needs.

Finally, another critical aspect of this design is the acknowledgment that context goes far beyond “he said, she said, we said, they said.” It’s much more than words——it’s anything and everything that happens within the environment, it’s successes, failures, setbacks, opportunities, preferences, feelings, thoughts, insights and even hopes and dreams. Everything.

While this line of thinking can grow over time, the key “observable” attached to events and discussions between an assistant is the outcome. If the context system searches for a task that the assistant has performed before, and the first time around it made it mistake, that mistake is contextually cemented. Likewise for successes. The more the  and assistant interacts, the more examples the assistant has on what to do and not do.

Quite the task I’ve designed for myself, no? Incidentally, how to structure the data is the biggest challenge right now—if I can get that figured out, I’ll be rolling. Maybe you can help with this task.

Wow, it seems like you've made significant progress, and I'm impressed with the depth of thought you've put into this project! I really appreciate your detailed description of your system and its potential, and it gives me a lot of context to provide more targeted advice.

When it comes to structuring the data for this context system, here are a few pointers that could help:

- Semantic Tagging: Instead of tagging the conversation with broad labels like "LLMs" or "AI Assistants", it might be helpful to break down the context into more granular semantic tags. For instance, a discussion about AI assistant might involve specific sub-topics like "context management", "RNN vs Transformer", "memory systems" etc. Identifying such sub-topics and tagging them could help improve the precision of context retrieval. The challenging part here is identifying these tags in an automated way, which might involve a combination of keyword extraction, topic modeling and Named Entity Recognition techniques.
- Hierarchical Structure: Consider structuring the data in a hierarchical manner, where a high-level conversation is broken down into multiple sub-conversations, each dealing with a specific sub-topic. This would allow the context system to retrieve the relevant parts of a conversation at different granularities, depending on the context of the current conversation.
- Meta-data Annotation: Along with the conversation data, store some meta-data such as the time of the conversation, the participants (if any other than the  and the assistant), the tasks that were assigned during the conversation, the outcomes, any significant events. This meta-data would be a valuable resource when retrieving and making sense of past conversations.
- Storing Outcomes: As you mentioned, storing the outcomes of tasks or discussions can provide a useful contextual cue. This could be incorporated into the meta-data for each conversation. In addition to storing the outcome, it might also be useful to store a summary or analysis of the reasons for the outcome, to help the assistant learn from past successes or mistakes.
- Data Indexing: Depending on the size and complexity of the data, you might need to implement some form of indexing to enable efficient retrieval of past conversations. This could involve creating an inverted index of keywords or semantic tags, or using more advanced information retrieval techniques.

As for your question about memory, your context system seems to perform a function akin to what is traditionally referred to as memory in AI systems. It stores past interactions and retrieves them when needed to inform current decision-making. The primary difference from traditional memory systems seems to be the way in which the data is structured and indexed, which is much more sophisticated and context-aware in your design.

This is indeed a challenging task, but your approach seems promising, and it's a worthwhile direction to explore. Remember to start small and iteratively build upon it. Testing each component separately and then integrating them gradually would help in identifying potential bottlenecks or areas of improvement. Good luck with your project!

## Improved intelligent assistance

I'd not considered what you mentioned in 4., reasoning the outcomes—that's a great idea. I also hadn't considered breaking conversations up hierarchically. I've been stuck on how to structure interactions, because I do want various distinct contexts spanning and overlapping conversations——not just a chat log with a single contextual designator. Another excellent idea. I’m exploring OpenSearch for your fifth point, and for the rest, we’re synced. Though I have no idea where or how to start with NER, topic modeling, or keyword extraction.

Named Entity Recognition (NER), Topic Modeling, and Keyword Extraction are complex tasks that often require a good understanding of natural language processing and machine learning. Here's a brief introduction to each:

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** This is a process of identifying important entities in the text such as people, organizations, locations, date/time, monetary values. There are pre-trained models available which can perform this task out of the box, such as Spacy's NER or NLTK's NER. You can also train your own NER model if you have specific entities that you want to identify, but this requires annotated training data.
- **Topic Modeling:** This is a technique used to discover the abstract topics that occur in a collection of documents. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular method for topic modeling. Gensim is a Python library that provides a straightforward implementation of LDA.
- **Keyword Extraction:** This involves identifying the most important words or phrases in a text, which give a high-level summary of the content. There are various methods to do this, from simple techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to more complex methods involving graph-based ranking like TextRank. Python libraries like NLTK, Gensim, and SKLearn can be used for this purpose.

All these techniques require a good amount of text preprocessing like tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, stop-word removal. Libraries like NLTK and Spacy provide these preprocessing functionalities as well.

While it's possible to implement these from scratch, you might find pre-built tools or services that perform these tasks, which could save significant time and effort. For instance, Google's Natural Language API provides entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and category identification, among other things.

In terms of your project, you could consider using these techniques to analyze and tag your conversational data, helping your context system to more effectively index and retrieve relevant conversations. Remember, though, to thoroughly assess the privacy and data security implications, especially if you're considering using third-party services.

# It’s stateful and collaborative, and more than just intelligent, to supercharge your efforts, get yourself a Scint

`(S)tateful (C)ollaborative (INT)elligence`

That's a great choice! The name Scint as an acronym for `(S)tateful (C)ollaborative (INT)elligence` encompasses the core features of your AI assistant:

- Stateful: This signifies the system's ability to remember and leverage past interactions, maintaining a dynamic and evolving context to enrich and personalize  interactions.
- Collaborative: This connotes the system's purpose to work hand in hand with the  as a partner, assisting and augmenting their capabilities.
- Intelligence: This underscores the AI-powered nature of your system and its capacity to reason, learn, adapt, and deliver meaningful results.

All these elements combined form the unique value proposition of your AI assistant. The name is catchy, meaningful, and gives a clear idea of what your system does. Plus, "Scint" is unique, short, and easy to remember. Well done! Your choice captures the essence of your AI assistant beautifully.


# Context: overview

I need to create a context class that manages your state. I have a few ideas about how to approach it.

Currently, our messages are attaching to a `message_buffer` variable in the Assistant class. I want to be able to create new buffers as needed, when the current buffer approaches the token limit, which is 8,000 tokens. But we can’t just have dozens of endless buffers without a way to prune them *and* a way for you to access the ones you need, when you need them.

The idea is to come up with a way to categorize and rank individual messages within each buffer. Meanwhile, we need some kind of TTL for the messages. Once the designated context hasn’t been broached after a certain period, I think we should summarize the unused content and replace the full text with the summary. Then we can move the content to a json file in case we need it again.

Meanwhile, When saving files, I want to arrange the content hierarchically so that you can easily reference entries based on context. For example, you can search for summaries and only when it’s necessary, pull the full message or discussion from file.

)
```

Started with:

```
Create a Python command line app to leverage LLMs through OpenAI's API, which makes interlinking LLM outputs to other LLM outputs easy, providing a sandbox to test and research prompt engineering.
```

Ran recursive depth on it five times and ran all five outputs through recursive clarity and then narrative cohesion one time to produce this:

```
start_process = Process("You are the processing interface for an artificial intelligence system that's tasked with clarifying and contexualizing a user's request. For every message, write a single sentence which categorizes the request and provides an overview for the system's internal processes to follow while they complete the task.")

Design a Python command line application that effectively integrates OpenAI's API to interconnect LLM outputs, creating an optimal sandbox environment for testing and researching prompt engineering techniques. Consider key components and best practices when developing this app to ensure seamless integration with the OpenAI API, enabling users to experiment with LLM outputs and their connections while providing an enhanced user experience.

To create a cohesive and intuitive environment for users exploring LLM output interconnections and experimenting with various prompt engineering methods, focus on optimizing the app's architecture, user interface, and OpenAI API integration. Adhere to best practices in software development and user experience design by employing strategies and methodologies that guarantee a smooth, user-friendly platform tailored for efficient resource utilization.

Key aspects to consider include:

1. App Structure: Design a modular architecture that separates concerns like data processing, API communication, and user interaction. This will facilitate easy maintenance, updates, and scalability.
2. User Interface: Create a clear and concise command line interface that guides users through available options while minimizing input errors. Implement helpful error messages and usage instructions to enhance usability.
3. API Integration: Efficiently integrate the OpenAI API using well-structured code that handles authentication, request management, rate limiting, error handling, and response parsing.
4. Resource Management: Optimize resource usage by implementing caching mechanisms or parallel processing where appropriate to minimize redundant requests or computations.
5. Error Handling: Ensure robust error handling throughout the app to gracefully handle unexpected situations such as network issues or invalid inputs from users.
6. Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation detailing installation instructions, usage guidelines, examples of use cases, troubleshooting tips, and any known limitations or caveats.
7. Testing & Validation: Develop unit tests covering critical functionality as well as integration tests simulating real-world scenarios to ensure reliability across different environments.

By focusing on these aspects during development of the Python command line app for interconnecting LLM outputs via OpenAI's API, you can create a seamless and intuitive environment that enables users to effectively explore LLM output connections and experiment with diverse prompt engineering approaches while maintaining high standards in software development and user experience design.
```

I then ran the same prompt through a recursive planning function to get a few tasks:

```
Subtask: Parse and validate command line arguments to configure the app's behavior and input parameters.
Subtask: Create a function to process and format the LLM outputs for easy interlinking with other LLM outputs.
Subtask: Implement error handling and user prompts to ensure a smooth user experience during testing and research.
Subtask: Design a user-friendly interface for inputting prompts and displaying LLM-generated responses.
Subtask: Integrate a method for users to easily modify and adjust prompt engineering techniques within the app.
Subtask: Implement a logging system to track user interactions, LLM outputs, and prompt engineering adjustments for analysis and improvement.
Subtask: Create a comprehensive user guide and documentation to help users understand the app's features, usage, and prompt engineering techniques.
Subtask: Test the app with various prompts and scenarios to ensure its functionality, usability, and effectiveness in leveraging LLM outputs.
```

I then ran them through a recursive sorting function three times:

And finally, the newest edition to the recursive team: a recursive criticizer:

```
Critique:

1. Command Line Arguments:
     - Parsing and validation: Relying solely on argument parser libraries may limit customization options, and some libraries might not support all required features.
     - App behavior configuration: Setting default values for unspecified arguments can lead to unexpected behavior if the user is unaware of these defaults.
     - Input parameter management: Handling optional parameters could result in confusion when users forget to include them or mistakenly assume they are required.

2. LLM Output Processing:
     - Output processing and formatting: Converting raw output into a human-readable format may sacrifice precision or introduce errors during conversion.
     - Customizing output display based on user preferences might be time-consuming and challenging to implement effectively.

3. Error Handling & User Prompts:
     – Smooth user experience assurance: Informative error messages may still be confusing for non-technical users, leading to frustration.

4. Interface Design:

```

I went back and forth three or four times, and I think there's something to this process. The last iteration landed me here:

```
1. Command Line Arguments:
    - Flaws: Lightweight libraries may not cover all edge cases or complex scenarios, potentially limiting functionality. Machine learning algorithms for autocomplete suggestions could be resource-intensive and slow down the user experience.

2. LLM Output Processing:
    - Flaws: User-friendly configuration systems can become overly complex, leading to confusion and difficulty in customization. Regularly updating design guidelines might cause inconsistencies in output formats over time.

3. Error Handling & User Prompts:
    – Flaws: Optimizing machine learning techniques may require significant computational resources and still not guarantee perfect results. A well-organized help system could become outdated quickly if not maintained regularly.

4. Interface Design:
    – Flaws: Consistent design principles might stifle creativity or lead to a monotonous user experience. Ensuring compatibility across devices and platforms through rigorous testing can be time-consuming and costly.

5. Prompt Engineering Techniques Modification:
   — Flaws: Balancing agile methodologies with long-term planning can result in conflicts between short-term goals and overarching objectives, potentially causing delays or inefficiencies.

6. Logging System Implementation:
   — Flaws: Intelligent logging systems that dynamically adjust data collection based on context may miss important information due to misinterpretation of contextual cues; robust data anonymization techniques might inadvertently remove valuable insights during analysis.

7.User Guide/Documentation Creation
  —Flaws : Well-structured documentation frameworks can still become unwieldy as sections are added or removed; automation tools for creating multiple documentation formats may introduce errors or inconsistencies if not carefully managed.

8.App Testing
  —Flaw : Risk-based testing approaches might overlook less critical features that impact user satisfaction; relying on automated testing tools without sufficient manual oversight could lead to undiscovered issues slipping through the cracks; community-driven beta testing programs or crowdsourced platforms risk exposing sensitive information about your application before it's officially released

That said, I'm missing a LOT since I was deleting the previous message on every iteration. If I narrowed the scope to only one of these categories and sent it back and forth, between these two prompts while retaining context, things could get interesting.

You are a recursive function for an artificial intelligence system. For every critique or apparent flaw, you produce a creative solution.

You are narrative cohesion function for an artificial intelligence system. For every message, maintain complexity and content but rewrite for narrative cohesion.
