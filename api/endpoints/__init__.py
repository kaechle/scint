# CRUD Operations:
# Create: Endpoints to create resources.
# Read: Endpoints to retrieve resources.
# Update: Endpoints to modify resources.
# Delete: Endpoints to remove resources.
# Bulk Operations:
# Consider endpoints that allow bulk create, update, and delete operations to make the API more efficient and reduce the number of API calls.
# Authentication and User Management:
# Register: Create a new user account.
# Login: Authenticate a user.
# Logout: End a user session.
# Password Reset: Allow users to reset their password.
# User Profile Management: Allow users to view and edit their profile.
# Resource Relationships:
# Consider how resources relate to each other and how you might expose these relationships via your API. For instance, if you have a user resource and a post resource, you might have endpoints like /users/{user_id}/posts to get all posts by a specific user.
# Search:
# Implement endpoints or query parameters that allow users to search through resources based on different criteria.
# Filtering and Sorting:
# Allow users to filter and sort resources based on various attributes.
# Pagination:
# Implement pagination to manage the retrieval of large data sets.
# Metadata Retrieval:
# Consider endpoints that allow users to retrieve metadata, such as available filters, sorting options, or related resources.
# Monitoring and Health Checks:
# Implement endpoints that provide the status of your application and its various components, which can be used for monitoring and alerting.
# File Handling:
# Upload: Allow users to upload files.
# Download: Allow users to download files.
# Data Export and Import:
# Consider endpoints that allow users to export data for offline use or analysis and import data to create or update bulk resources.
# Asynchronous Processing:
# If you have operations that take a long time to process, consider implementing asynchronous endpoints that return a task ID, which can be polled to check the status of the operation.
