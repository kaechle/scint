# Scint

Scint is an intelligent assistant engineered to augment user productivity and automate tasks across various domains. Its functionality encompasses research and analysis, planning and management for projects and tasks, and content generation using sophisticated data pipelines. These capabilities are supported by enhanced memory and context.

## Features

> Note: Scint is still in the early stages of development

Many of Scint's features are still in development. Likewise, given the still-early stages of exploration into the capabilities of LLMs, defining these features is still just as much exploration as it is design decisions.

That said, the general premise of Scint is to build a personalized, semi-autonomous assistant that maintains contextual awareness and can actually *help* you accomplish tasks, not just serve as an on-demand Stack Overflow. Above all, Scint is about seamlessly blending the generative capabilities of LLMs into existing workflows.

The rundown:

- Enhanced state and context management
- Advanced content generation using prompt pipelines
- Access to, processing, and manipulation of data
- Access to outside data via APIs
- Use via API, CLI, or web interface
- Access to a sandbox for file creation, modification, and testing
- Project and task management and notifications
- Built-in configuration for easy customization and personalization
- Plugins to add or customize models or expand capabilities

## Progress

The foundational aspects of Scint are still under development. While the code is open source and anyone's free to poke around, use, and modify it, I'm not accepting contributions at the moment. Once the project is closer to feature-completion, I'll consider this and other aspects.
