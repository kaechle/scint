## Questions

1.	User Interface and Experience
 - What specific widgets and metrics are needed on the control panel for each server type?
 - How should the interface layout be structured to maximize usability and efficiency?
 - Are there customization options for the dashboard or widgets that users can modify?
2.	Server and Dashboard Functionality
 - What types of servers (e.g., web, application, database) and specific functionalities should be accessible through the control panel?
 - How are the metrics for each widget sourced and updated in real-time?
 - What are the technical requirements for the graphs and analytics (e.g., real-time updates, historical data visualization)?
3.	AI Capabilities and Natural Language Processing
 - What level of natural language understanding is required? Does it need to support multiple languages or dialects?
 - How should the system handle ambiguous or incomplete user inputs?
 - What backend architecture supports the AIâ€™s decision-making processes?
4.	Integration and Intercommunication
 - How will different systems communicate and share context or state information?
 - What protocols or technologies will be used to ensure seamless, secure communication between systems?
 - Are there fallbacks or manual overrides if AI decisions need to be reviewed or corrected by human operators?
5.	Security and Data Privacy
 - What security measures are required to protect user data and unauthorized access to the control panel?
 - How will data be encrypted, both at rest and in transit?
 - Are there compliance or regulatory considerations depending on the server locations or data types?
6.	Scalability and Maintenance
 - How scalable should the backend be to handle potential increases in users or data volume?
 - What tools and processes will be implemented for monitoring, logging, and maintaining the system?
 - How will updates and upgrades be managed without disrupting ongoing operations?
7.	Emergency Protocols and Thresholds
 - How does the system recognize and handle potential emergencies or failures?
 - What are the specific thresholds for alerts and automatic adjustments?
 - How are these thresholds set, and can they be adjusted by users?
