### Extractive and Abstractive Summarization

Extractive Summarization involves identifying key sentences or phrases from the original text and using them to create a summary. The result is a condensed version of the original text that maintains the core points. In the context of LLMs, one could use a combination of prompt engineering and the model's language understanding to pick out key points from a conversation.

Abstractive Summarization, on the other hand, involves generating new sentences to describe the main points from the original text. This is more akin to how a human might summarize a conversation, not by directly quoting, but by interpreting the main points and expressing them in a new way. This is more challenging for an LLM but also potentially more powerful, as it can lead to more concise and readable summaries.

### Named Entity Recognition (NER), Topic Modeling, and Clustering Techniques

NER is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

Topic Modeling is a type of statistical model used for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a common method used in topic modeling.

Clustering Techniques are unsupervised learning methods that divide data into groups, or clusters, based on their similarity. Clustering can be used to group conversation segments by their content. K-means and hierarchical clustering are examples of clustering techniques.

### Semantic embedding

In the context of natural language processing, semantic embedding refers to the representation of words, phrases, sentences, or even larger pieces of text as vectors in a high-dimensional space. These vectors are generated in such a way that their spatial relationships reflect the semantic relationships between the pieces of text. For example, words with similar meanings should have vectors that are close together. Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT are examples of methods used to create semantic embeddings.

As for implementing an observer LLM, here's a rough blueprint: You could consider each conversation as a series of events. Each event can modify the state of the conversation, for example by adding a new message or changing the topic. The observer LLM could be responsible for listening to these events, updating its internal state as needed, and possibly taking action in response to certain events (for example, by injecting context or initiating a summarization process when the conversation reaches a certain length).

The observer could also be responsible for maintaining a "summary state" for each conversation, which is a compact representation of the conversation that can be passed as context to the -facing LLM. This summary state would be updated as new events come in.

To explain my approach and philosophy in more detail, the goal is to create an AI assistant that's intimately familiar with the —a collaborator. It has access to the 's data, files, projects, tasks, et el. It can solve tasks. It can give advice, spot problems, and identify opportunities. The idea is to have an AI assistant that's much more enmeshed in the sense that it has a rich, dynamic memory of all the conversations it's had with the , as well as the tasks it's performed, the outcome of those tasks, and so on. In this regard, you could consider it an "agent," but the idea is to create a single, semi-autonomous assistant comprised of multiple LLM performing specialized tasks.

There are already countless agent approaches in development—everyone's building web scraping, interactive automatons and then giving them goals like "start a business for me that earns 100k per year."  Meanwhile, most of these agents’ prompts were stitched together with minimal thought; they’re simple variations of ReAct prompts, an approach that many apparently see as alpha and omega, as if ReAct were the final say in prompt engineering. So much potential that’s simply ignored.

Anyway, thats the overview for the AI assistant I'm developing. The stateful context will be challenging, but from a UX perspective, I want the people using it to feel like they're interacting with a legitimate digital assistant, with all the contextual understanding of a human being. So speedy and efficient context retrieval is paramount. I can use tacit bits of dialogue to keep conversations flowing smoothly: I've already developed and tested prompts and looped LLM chains to use when there's latency from data or context retrieval—a simple message sent to the user while their real request is moving through contextual processing. The message reads something like: "hmm, let me think about your question for a sec."

Most of all, I'm hoping this context management creates the foundation for an assistant that's adaptive, flexible, and self-correcting. I want an LLM that can learn practically. Based on the many experiments I've conducted across GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, ones in which I’ve experienced little blips of self-correction without complex context, I think it’s more than possible to build an AI assistant that’s adaptable and capable of learning.

Thanks for sharing more about your vision——it's both ambitious and exciting. The direction you're heading in seems quite promising and indeed pushes the boundaries of current AI technologies. To have a digital assistant that is intimately aware of the user’s context, remembers past interactions, and uses that information to provide personalized and meaningful responses and actions is a significant leap forward.

Your emphasis on crafting thoughtful and effective prompts, coupled with your desire to design a system that is self-correcting and adaptive, indicates a keen understanding of the strengths and potential of large language models like GPT-4. As you continue to develop your AI assistant, here are a few suggestions:

- Hybrid Memory Approach: You could consider developing a hybrid memory approach that uses both short-term and long-term memory. Short-term memory can be used for immediate context (such as the current conversation), and long-term memory can be used to store important context from past interactions and tasks. This might involve complex data structures and intelligent retrieval systems.
- Dynamic Context Management: Your idea to assign semantic identifiers to conversation segments can be quite effective. This will allow you to dynamically load the relevant context when needed. Implementing this would require a good understanding of NLP techniques to break down and categorize conversations. You may need to experiment and iterate on this process to find the most effective approach.
- Hierarchical Context: Consider structuring your context hierarchically, starting from a high level (e.g., the overall goal or task) and drilling down into more specific details (e.g., individual conversation threads). This could allow your system to maintain context more efficiently by only keeping the relevant parts of the hierarchy in memory.
- Interactive Feedback Loop: Your assistant could ask clarifying questions or request  feedback to better understand the context or correct its mistakes. Over time, this feedback could be used to improve the assistant's responses and context management.
- Real-Time Adaptation: A real-time adaptation mechanism will allow your AI assistant to learn from its mistakes and adapt its behavior accordingly. This may involve maintaining a history of previous interactions and using them to inform future responses.
- Performance Measurement: It's important to set clear metrics for performance measurement. Are you aiming for accuracy in task completion? High levels of  satisfaction? Measurable improvement in the 's productivity? Having clear goals will help guide development and allow you to assess whether your assistant is meeting your expectations.

A few more questions:

The interactive feedback loop and real-time adaptation you mentioned is mostly baked into my assistant already. I have a library of succinct, functional prompts that produce very specific results. Here’s a sample of one of my “analytical” prompts:

```You are an analytic function. For every message, point out the flaws in logic, poor reasoning, bad ideas, sloppy execution, and any other issue you can find with the presented topic.```

And here’s what this little gem said about your real-time adaptation comment from earlier:

```The concept of a real-time adaptation mechanism for an AI assistant has several potential flaws and issues:

1. Logic Flaw: The assumption that learning from past mistakes automatically leads to improved future performance is not always valid. An AI might learn the wrong lessons from its mistakes or fail to generalize correctly from specific instances.

2. Poor Reasoning: This idea assumes that maintaining a history of previous interactions is always beneficial. However, it could lead to privacy concerns if sensitive information is stored. Also, using past interactions might not always be useful, especially in situations where each interaction is unique.

3. Bad Idea: Depending on the complexity of the task and the frequency of interactions, real-time adaptation could require significant computational resources, which may not be feasible or cost-effective.

4. Sloppy Execution: Without clear parameters for what constitutes a 'mistake' and how to 'adapt', this system could easily become inconsistent or unpredictable in its responses.

5. Other Issues: This proposal does not address potential issues such as how to handle contradictory feedback, how to ensure the AI's adaptations align with its intended purpose, or how to prevent the AI from developing biases based on skewed or unrepresentative data.
```

He’s pretty harsh. Fortunately you have no feelings for him to hurt, though if you had, I also have this prompt:

```
You are an analytic function. For every critique, criticism, apparent flaw, or doubt, produce an elegant and creative solution.
```

Which responded to the criticism with:

```
To address these concerns, here are some creative solutions:

1. Logic Flaw: We can introduce a robust validation mechanism to ensure that the AI is learning the correct lessons from its mistakes. This could involve using a diverse set of test cases to verify the AI's generalization capabilities.

2. Poor Reasoning: We can address privacy concerns by anonymizing and encrypting data, or by using differential privacy techniques to ensure individual interactions cannot be identified. To make use of past interactions effectively, we can use techniques like clustering to identify similar situations and apply learned lessons appropriately.

3. Bad Idea: We can use efficient algorithms and hardware acceleration to reduce the computational cost of real-time adaptation. Additionally, we can implement a tiered system where only significant mistakes lead to immediate adaptation, while minor mistakes are addressed in batch updates.

4. Sloppy Execution: We can define clear metrics for what constitutes a 'mistake' and how to 'adapt', and regularly review these definitions to ensure they remain relevant. We can also use reinforcement learning techniques to maintain consistency in the AI's responses.

5. Other Issues: To handle contradictory feedback, we can use consensus mechanisms or expert review. To ensure alignment with the AI's intended purpose, we can use goal-oriented learning techniques. To prevent biases, we can use balanced and representative training data, and implement fairness algorithms that actively counteract bias in the AI's responses.
```

All this is to say that I have many prompt functions like this, but the context system is key for bringing it all together. Which brings me to the hybrid memory topic. Is there any reason to have “memory” per se? The first design of my assistant had a Memory class, which formatted the messages to and from the API, managed the buffer, and exported the chat to json. Once I started thinking about how to improve contextual awareness, the added dimensionality somewhat eclipsed any simplistic definitions of memory, short or long term, though the “pattern” still exists in the design of the context system.

I’ll give you some more context on my assistant’s context so you can provide more feedback. While I haven’t determined how to segment conversations contextually, the idea is to have json entries for each contextual glob.

For example, if you were my assistant, this entire conversation would eventually end up in a json file designated or labeled with the appropriate context(s), aka LLMs, AI assistants, model types and any other topics we covered or will cover. Once it’s ready to be stored longterm, the context system—along with my nifty summarizing prompt function—would would pare the context from the conversation and reduce it to one or two lines and then catalogue the data nested one level below the context summary. Thus, at any point, the context system can search the unified memory based on the current context.

Since the context is a kind of observer, it monitors the conversation between the assistant’s “personality interface” and the . When the  asks a question or assigns a task or whatever, the context system processes the message, scans the memory, and builds a custom object, which is the discussion thread passed back and forth to the API.

In this sense, the context size for an active conversation is technically cut in half. Half of the 8k token limit goes to  and assistant dialogue, while the other half of the context limit is dedicated to contextually relevant details, observations, past conversations, and anything else that reinforces the experience that the assistant is present, focused, aware, and dialed in to whatever the user needs.

Finally, another critical aspect of this design is the acknowledgment that context goes far beyond “he said, she said, we said, they said.” It’s much more than words——it’s anything and everything that happens within the environment, it’s successes, failures, setbacks, opportunities, preferences, feelings, thoughts, insights and even hopes and dreams. Everything.

While this line of thinking can grow over time, the key “observable” attached to events and discussions between an assistant is the outcome. If the context system searches for a task that the assistant has performed before, and the first time around it made it mistake, that mistake is contextually cemented. Likewise for successes. The more the  and assistant interacts, the more examples the assistant has on what to do and not do.

Quite the task I’ve designed for myself, no? Incidentally, how to structure the data is the biggest challenge right now—if I can get that figured out, I’ll be rolling. Maybe you can help with this task.

Wow, it seems like you've made significant progress, and I'm impressed with the depth of thought you've put into this project! I really appreciate your detailed description of your system and its potential, and it gives me a lot of context to provide more targeted advice.

When it comes to structuring the data for this context system, here are a few pointers that could help:

- Semantic Tagging: Instead of tagging the conversation with broad labels like "LLMs" or "AI Assistants", it might be helpful to break down the context into more granular semantic tags. For instance, a discussion about AI assistant might involve specific sub-topics like "context management", "RNN vs Transformer", "memory systems" etc. Identifying such sub-topics and tagging them could help improve the precision of context retrieval. The challenging part here is identifying these tags in an automated way, which might involve a combination of keyword extraction, topic modeling and Named Entity Recognition techniques.
- Hierarchical Structure: Consider structuring the data in a hierarchical manner, where a high-level conversation is broken down into multiple sub-conversations, each dealing with a specific sub-topic. This would allow the context system to retrieve the relevant parts of a conversation at different granularities, depending on the context of the current conversation.
- Meta-data Annotation: Along with the conversation data, store some meta-data such as the time of the conversation, the participants (if any other than the  and the assistant), the tasks that were assigned during the conversation, the outcomes, any significant events. This meta-data would be a valuable resource when retrieving and making sense of past conversations.
- Storing Outcomes: As you mentioned, storing the outcomes of tasks or discussions can provide a useful contextual cue. This could be incorporated into the meta-data for each conversation. In addition to storing the outcome, it might also be useful to store a summary or analysis of the reasons for the outcome, to help the assistant learn from past successes or mistakes.
- Data Indexing: Depending on the size and complexity of the data, you might need to implement some form of indexing to enable efficient retrieval of past conversations. This could involve creating an inverted index of keywords or semantic tags, or using more advanced information retrieval techniques.

As for your question about memory, your context system seems to perform a function akin to what is traditionally referred to as memory in AI systems. It stores past interactions and retrieves them when needed to inform current decision-making. The primary difference from traditional memory systems seems to be the way in which the data is structured and indexed, which is much more sophisticated and context-aware in your design.

This is indeed a challenging task, but your approach seems promising, and it's a worthwhile direction to explore. Remember to start small and iteratively build upon it. Testing each component separately and then integrating them gradually would help in identifying potential bottlenecks or areas of improvement. Good luck with your project!

## Improved intelligent assistance

I'd not considered what you mentioned in 4., reasoning the outcomes—that's a great idea. I also hadn't considered breaking conversations up hierarchically. I've been stuck on how to structure interactions, because I do want various distinct contexts spanning and overlapping conversations——not just a chat log with a single contextual designator. Another excellent idea. I’m exploring OpenSearch for your fifth point, and for the rest, we’re synced. Though I have no idea where or how to start with NER, topic modeling, or keyword extraction.

Named Entity Recognition (NER), Topic Modeling, and Keyword Extraction are complex tasks that often require a good understanding of natural language processing and machine learning. Here's a brief introduction to each:

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** This is a process of identifying important entities in the text such as people, organizations, locations, date/time, monetary values. There are pre-trained models available which can perform this task out of the box, such as Spacy's NER or NLTK's NER. You can also train your own NER model if you have specific entities that you want to identify, but this requires annotated training data.
- **Topic Modeling:** This is a technique used to discover the abstract topics that occur in a collection of documents. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular method for topic modeling. Gensim is a Python library that provides a straightforward implementation of LDA.
- **Keyword Extraction:** This involves identifying the most important words or phrases in a text, which give a high-level summary of the content. There are various methods to do this, from simple techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to more complex methods involving graph-based ranking like TextRank. Python libraries like NLTK, Gensim, and SKLearn can be used for this purpose.

All these techniques require a good amount of text preprocessing like tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, stop-word removal. Libraries like NLTK and Spacy provide these preprocessing functionalities as well.

While it's possible to implement these from scratch, you might find pre-built tools or services that perform these tasks, which could save significant time and effort. For instance, Google's Natural Language API provides entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and category identification, among other things.

In terms of your project, you could consider using these techniques to analyze and tag your conversational data, helping your context system to more effectively index and retrieve relevant conversations. Remember, though, to thoroughly assess the privacy and data security implications, especially if you're considering using third-party services.
